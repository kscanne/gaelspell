Only a handful of people have corresponded with me about these packages
and no one has contributed any words.  Perhaps having an appeal in English
will inspire some learners to contribute.

GaelSpell development is hosted at 
<a href="https://github.com/kscanne/gaelspell/">Github</a>.
There you'll find the source repository (going back to 2001), 
bug tracking system, and the project wiki.

<p>
I have the software infrastructure in place so that if
someone sends me a list of "headwords" with grammatical information,
all inflected forms of the word will be added automatically.  This is a
much more efficient (and less error-prone) way of building up a good 
word list than by adding forms one by one into a personal dictionary.
</p>

<p>
The word list already contains a large number of Irish personal names and
placenames, but these were not added in any systematic way, and there are
possibly quality issues.  If there is anyone with a particular interest
in this area that would like to help, please get in touch with me
at kscanne at gmail dot com.
