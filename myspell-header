# hunspell affix file for Irish by Kevin Scannell
# I created this file by converting my ispell affix file on 5 August 2002
# Exactly the same set of affixes, except one can avoid the acrobatics
# for the verb "buígh" because hunspell is a bit smarter about
# combining affixes
#
#               ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
