Several thousand people are using GaelSpell on a regular basis,
either the Firefox or LibreOffice addon, or
version for Microsoft Word published by
<a target="_blank" href="https://cruinneog.com/">Cruinneog</a>.
Unfortunately, only rarely has anyone suggested new
words for addition to the database; I'd love to see many more people
contribute to the project in this way.
</p>

<p>
GaelSpell development is hosted on
<a href="https://github.com/kscanne/gaelspell/">GitHub</a>.
There you'll find the source code repository (going back to 2001)
and the system we use for tracking bugs and enhancement requests.
If you'd rather not bother with GitHub, you are welcome to email
me questions or suggestions (kscanne at gmail ponc com).

The Firefox and LibreOffice addons allow users to add words to 
a “personal dictionary” when GaelSpell flags a word as
incorrect even though you're happy with it, as happens 
frequently with proper names and sometimes with dialect forms.
Because of this, a very easy way to contribute words is to
submit the contents of your personal dictionary.
Where this file is stored depends on the application you're using 
GaelSpell with, and the operating system you are using.
For example on Mac OS X the Firefox personal dictionary is stored here:
</p>

<pre>
~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/{profilename}/persdict.dat
</pre>

<p>
More information is available from
<a target="_blank" href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Dictionaries#Personal_dictionary">mozillaZine</a>.
</p>

<p>
For LibreOffice (version 4 or later) on Mac OS X, the personal dictionary
is stored here:
</p>

<pre>
~/Library/Application Support/LibreOffice/4/user/wordbook/standard.dic
</pre>

<p>

<p>
The GaelSpell word list already contains a large number of
Irish personal names and placenames, but these were not added 
in a very systematic way, and there are likely quite a few gaps
in coverage.  If there is anyone with a particular interest
in this area that would like to help, don't hesitate to get in
touch with me at kscanne at gmail ponc com.
